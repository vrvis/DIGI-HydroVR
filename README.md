# DIGI-HydroVR
Adapted code from IATK for DIGI-Hydro VR Project

This repository is an adaptation of part of the Immersive Analytics Toolkit (IATK) by Maxime Cordeil and Andrew Cunningham, and is intended to be used in conjunction with IATK.

The DIGIHydroVis is a new abstract visualization type that creates a full-scale 3D plot centered on the origin of the scene. This script was used in the DIGI-Hydro VR project to display streamlines from flow simulations. 

To use this code, you need to add the Immersive Analytics Toolkit (IATK) to your Unity project. Add the DIGIHydroVis.cs and PosScaleUtil.cs scripts to your Unity project and replace the Visualisation.cs and AbstractVisualisation.cs scripts in the IATK folder.
